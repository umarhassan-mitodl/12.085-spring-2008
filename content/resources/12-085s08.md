description: Atmospheric CO2 levels (measured in parts per million by volume (ppmv)
  of dry air) from 1958 to 2004 as measured at Mauna Loa. The cause for the yearly
  rise and fall is the annual cycle of plant respiration. The cause of the increasing
  trend is supposedly the anthropogenic release of CO2, mainly due to the use of fossil
  energy sources. (Image courtesy of the Wikimedia Commons, data provided by the U.S.
