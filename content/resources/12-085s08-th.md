  caption: "Atmospheric CO\u2082 levels (measured in parts per million by volume (ppmv)\
    \ of dry air) from 1958 to 2004 as measured at Mauna Loa. The cause for the yearly\
    \ rise and fall is the annual cycle of plant respiration. The cause of the increasing\
    \ trend is supposedly the anthropogenic release of CO\u2082, mainly due to the\
    \ use of fossil energy sources. (Image courtesy of the {{% resource_link \"d0e65b7b-1e27-4df3-baff-2a2d5f75d0b1\"\
